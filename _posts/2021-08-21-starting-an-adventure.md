It has finally happened! After months of planning and seemingly never-ending admin (i.e. the untold pain of being an adult), I am in beautiful Edinburgh. Right *now*, I am actually cooped up inside a hotel room, but with the city in sight and my quarantine period nearing its end, it truly feels like the adventure has begun.

Though starting a blog feels like a natural thing to do when embarking on such a journey, my desire to create this outlet has been brewing for quite some time. This is not because I feel my life is particularly interesting---on the contrary, my hesitation to write publicly thus far has stemmed from the feeling that it would be inconsequential, and therefore unnecessary. Moreover, writing publicly is scary. It is saying: this is me, this is my life, these are my ideas. And yet, the desire to share my thoughts, to air my ideas, has remained. Every time I 

Of course, the world has social media platforms, and perhaps it is my fault for discarding that perfect opportunity. Two years ago, I deleted all of my accounts as an attempt to declutter my mind. I was, and am, philosophically opposed to these glorified advertising agencies on a macro level: their invasive methods to violate our privacy, their predatory business practices, their insatiable desire for our screen time. But my reasons extended to a personal level too: it *felt* like my relationships were thriving due to the regular interactions that made my reptilian brain fizz, whereas they were in fact stagnating through passive interactions that required no real work.

A blog and/or email newsletter approach feels like a healthy middle-ground for me: social media, in a sense, not incentivised by profit. Which means, hopefully, if you are reading what I write, it is because you care, or you are interested, or you have something meaningful to contribute. Not because I was the highest bidder for your attention, or because I used the right keywords for it to reach your homepage. Instead, I hope simply to share my adventure with the people who are interested in it. This does not limit me to people who I know personally---else I could just start a private group---for I believe sharing things publicly allows ideas to flesh out and grow. I like the idea of sharing what I do and what I see, along with the ideas that are ruminating within me. But I want to do this organically.

In this season, moving overseas, starting a distinctly new chapter in my life, seems to be an appropriate re-entry point to the world of the internet.
