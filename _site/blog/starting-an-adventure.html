  <h1><b>Starting an Adventure and a Blog</b></h1>
</div>

<p class="post-metadata text-muted">
  29 August 2021 -  
  <b>5 mins read time</b>

  <br></p>

<p>It has finally happened! After months of planning and seemingly never-ending admin (i.e. the untold pain of being an adult), I am in beautiful Edinburgh. Right <em>now</em>, I am actually cooped up inside a hotel room, but with the city in sight and my quarantine period nearing its end, it truly feels like the adventure has begun.</p>

<h3 id="blog-motivations">Blog Motivations</h3>

<p>Though starting a blog feels like a natural thing to do when embarking on such a journey, my desire to create this outlet has been brewing for quite some time. This is not because I feel my life is particularly interesting—on the contrary, my hesitation to write publicly thus far has stemmed from the feeling that it would be inconsequential, and therefore unnecessary. But I cannot shake the urge to share my thoughts, to air my ideas, to throw things against the wall and see what sticks. Again, not because these ideas are special, but because the <em>process of sharing ideas</em> is special. This one exercise is what has catalysed the entirety of human development. Therefore, I want to do it.</p>

<p>Of course, doing so is daunting. It is saying: this is me, this is my life, these are my ideas. Yet, I am encouraged by the poet Savannah Brown’s words <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKV-cym4QfQ&amp;t=852s" target="_blank">here</a>, on the topic of sharing one’s creations, sharing one’s art:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s scary to be known—to let things be seen. To say: this is as good as I can do, and I hope it finds you well. But the ability to create is an evolutionary birthright that is impossible not to be worthy of, and really short-sighted to waste. And when you consider that—what it actually means to be here at all and able to do anything—thoughts of, “oh, I’m worried it’s not good enough,” sort of dissipate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some senses, I am overthinking this process of sharing updates from my life—after all, this is just a travel blog of sorts; what is the big deal? I like the idea of documenting what I do and what I see, and that itself is a fairly straightforward and uncontroversial process. However, in time, as I gain confidence, I hope to surface the ideas that are ruminating deeper within me. I wish to share more honestly my perspectives of the world—especially as these perspectives are inevitably moulded and nurtured through my travels and adventures. Moreover, I hope to be challenged—I trust that the reward for my honesty will be genuine dialogue, which too will grow me as an individual.</p>

<p>The decision that remains, then, is which medium to use. Naturally, I am compelled to step onto the gigantic stages of social media, which offer both an enormous audience and the unparalleled convenience of reaching them. However, unfortunately, the cost of these upsides is arguably outweighed by that of their downsides. Fundamentally, I am opposed to most of these glorified advertising agencies on a macro level: their invasive methods to violate our privacy, their predatory business practices, their insatiable desire for our screen time. But my grievances extend to a personal level too: when I was using social media, it <em>felt</em> like my relationships were thriving due to the regular engagements that made my reptilian brain fizz; whereas they were, in fact, stagnating through passive interactions that required no real work. Social media lacks intentionality, and this leaves me wanting.</p>

<p>With this in mind, a blog and/or newsletter approach feels like a healthy middle-ground for me: it is a form of social media, in a sense, that leverages the power and reach of the internet, but is not incentivised by profit. This means, hopefully, if you are reading what I write, it is because you care, or you are interested, or you have something meaningful to contribute. Not because I was the highest bidder for your attention, nor because I used the right keywords for it to reach your homepage. Instead, I hope simply to share my adventure with the people who are invested in my life and intend to engage with the stories that unfold within it. This does not necessarily limit me to people who I know personally—else I could just start a private forum—for I believe sharing ideas <em>openly</em> allows them to flesh out and grow in a unique way. It allows me to receive feedback from a diverse audience, not simply an echo chamber.</p>

<p>And so, here it is: my blog! I cannot promise it will always be interesting, and as I travel deeper into the thicket of my master’s degree, I cannot promise it will always be up-to-date—for I anticipate a mad year ahead. Nonetheless, I hope it will allow me to double the joys and halve the sorrows, to experience collectively the new sights and sounds, and the lessons wrapped within them. I trust, too, that it will encourage me to slow down and appreciate moments as they occur. Life is fleeting and I don’t want to miss it.</p>

<p>With that preamble out of the way, I am excited to share my journey of the past week.</p>
